# Remote Network Connection Socks Proxy Gateway

Remote Network Connection VPN solution - much more than just a VPN 

Remote Network Connection is a comprehensive VPN solution and platform that uses the SSL/TLS protocol to establish an encrypted channel. SSL/TLS is a protocol widely used on the Internet. Its best-known, ubiquitous application is HTTPS, which is used to encrypt the traffic of websites. By default, HTTPS uses Port 443 for communication. This communication protocol is well known by all firewalls and proxy devices. It can also be managed and forwarded easily in a NAT environment. 

Using a secure connection via the Internet, the Remote Network Connection VPN solution establishes a VPN session between the remote and the local virtual network adapters and forwards all Ethernet frames between the two networks. The Remote Network Connection VPN network consists of the Remote Network Connection server and multiple Remote Network Connection applications. The Remote Network Connection VPN solution guarantees a fully transparent connection between two or more network adapters - as if they were on the very same network segment.
